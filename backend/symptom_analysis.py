"""
AI Symptom Analysis Module
---------------------------
Corresponds to the "AI SYMPTOM ANALYSIS" stage: takes extracted symptoms and
performs pattern analysis against the Medical Knowledge Base to surface
possible causes (conditions), each with an explainable confidence score.

Rule-based and explainable by design -- every match traces back to exactly
which symptoms triggered it. Swap `SymptomAnalyzer.analyze()` for a call into
a real embedding/LLM model later; nothing downstream needs to change since it
only depends on the ConditionMatch shape returned here.
